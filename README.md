# Typify

Typify allows you to test your typing speed. The results are expressed in terms
of words per minute (WPM).

The faster you can type, the faster you will be able to communicate with others.
This is especially true if you are a programmer. You can save a ton of time on any
kind of work that requires typing. At first, you will save a couple of extra minutes
that you wonâ€™t really notice. Over time the minutes will turn into hours of saved
time, which you can spend on other activities.

Typify is written with React and Material UI. You can find the live demo powered
by GitHub Pages [here](https://itssamuelrowe.github.io/typify-demo/).

## Words Per Minute (WPM)

In this type of test, your typing skills are expressed in words per minute, hence the name.
The more you practice, the faster you type, the higher the WPM score will be.

The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:

  "homepage" : "http://myname.github.io/myapp",

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  serve -s build
